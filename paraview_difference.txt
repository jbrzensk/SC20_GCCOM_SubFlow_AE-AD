- Select the two data sets in the file browser
- Filter -> Alphabetical -> Programmable Filter

# 'T' is temperature variable for GCCOM
# 'P' is pressure variable from SubFlow

# Command is as follows:
phi_0 = inputs[0].PointData['P']
phi_1 = inputs[1].PointData['P']
output.PointData.append(phi_1 - phi_0, 'difference')
